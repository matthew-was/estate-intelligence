# Initial purpose

This project started with two main goals. The first was to create a workable system for archiving decades of documentation for a farming estate but maintain it as a reference. The second reason was to better learn how to use AI as a software developer.

I am a javascript/typescript developer with almost 10 years of experience. This gives me a strong background in software development, but the speed of AI adoption has left me a little behind the curve. Utilising AI workflows to build this project and AI systems within the project the outcome should be that at the end I am a stronger developer with an in demand skill set.
