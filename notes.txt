# Notes

SUMMARY.md

- initial documentation moved to archive
- new agent - pair-programmer for help with learning when I'm writing code
- integration lead owns backend api service that talks to the db, not just the db.
- need product owner first to ensure everything in project directory is complete?

architecture.md

- need some work on the monorepo structure

agent-workflow.md

- would like to refine the higher level (product owner and head of engineering agents) in the development workflow
- what is definition of done between steps of the workflow, particularly in handoff from product owner -> head of development -> senior developer/integration lead.


Need to run the following in the claude chats:

  Review this entire conversation and extract anything relevant to the Estate Intelligence project.
  Specifically, look for:

  1. **Decisions made** — any choice between two or more approaches where one was selected, with or without explicit rationale.

  2. **Rationale that is implied but not written down** — any "we chose X because..." or "we avoided Y because..."

  3. **Constraints or requirements that emerged** — anything that narrowed what the system must or must not do.

  4. **Anything that contradicts an existing decision** — note any tension with these already-decided ADRs:
     - Infrastructure as Configuration (all services behind interfaces)
     - Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
     - Three-layer security (Browser → Next.js → Express)
     - PostgreSQL + pgvector (not a dedicated vector DB)
     - 4-component pipeline (C1 Intake, C2 Extraction+Embedding, C3 Query, C4 Continuous Ingestion)
     - Human-maintained domain context (system flags, never auto-adds)

  Format your response as bullet points grouped by category. For each item, quote or closely paraphrase the relevant part of the conversation so I know where it came from.
