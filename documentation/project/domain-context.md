# Domain Context

## What This Document Is

This is a living working document maintained by the developer. It stores the authoritative terminology, entity names, and domain-specific knowledge for the estate archive.

**Why it exists**: Component 2 encounters terms, place names, and people it doesn't recognise. Rather than autonomously deciding what these mean, it tracks candidate terms and presents them here for your review. You decide what gets added, corrected, or rejected. Once approved, reprocessing documents with the updated context improves categorisation, entity extraction, and search quality.

## How to Use This Document

**Regular workflow**:

1. After processing a batch of documents, check the domain context candidate tracking file generated by Component 2
2. Review candidates — approve the ones that are correct, reject the ones that are noise
3. Add approved terms to the relevant tables below
4. Trigger reprocessing for affected documents (Phase 2+ automated workflow)

**When to add directly (without candidate review)**:

- You know a term is important before processing (known field names, family names)
- A search fails to find something you know should be there (indicates missing context)

## Candidate Review Queue

Terms flagged by Component 2 as appearing frequently but not yet approved. Review these and move to the appropriate table above, or reject them.

*(Component 2 Phase 2 will populate this automatically. In Phase 1, manually record candidates discovered during processing.)*

## Rejection Log

Terms explicitly rejected so Component 2 doesn't re-flag them.

## Notes for Component 2 Processing

*(Add any processing notes here that help refine how Component 2 interprets estate documents — e.g., "documents from the 1960s use informal plot names that were formalised in the 1980s")*
