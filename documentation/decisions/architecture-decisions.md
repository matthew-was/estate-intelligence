# Architecture Decisions

> This file is populated by the Head of Development agent.
>
> The agent reads the pre-approval ADRs from
> `documentation/previous documentation to be reviewed/decisions/architecture-decisions.md`,
> evaluates each one against the approved `user-requirements.md`, and writes the valid ADRs here.
> It then resolves the 15 Architectural Flags from `user-requirements.md` and records new ADRs
> for each decision made.
>
> Do not add content to this file manually before the Head of Development session.
